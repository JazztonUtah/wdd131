Magnus Chase has always been a troubled kid. Since his mother's mysterious death, he's lived alone on the streets of Boston, surviving by his wits. One day, he's tracked down by an uncle he barely knows who tells him an impossible secret: Magnus is the son of a Norse god. The Viking myths are true. The gods of Asgard are preparing for war. Trolls, giants, and worse monsters are stirring for doomsday. To prevent Ragnarok, Magnus must search the Nine Worlds for a weapon that has been lost for thousands of years. This epic adventure combines humor, heart, and Norse mythology in classic Riordan style!"

Garion, a simple farm boy, finds himself swept up in events beyond his understanding. As he travels with Aunt Pol and the mysterious Wolf, he begins to discover that his world is far more complex than he ever imagined, and his own destiny may be tied to the fate of the world itself. This classic fantasy series is a must-read for fans of epic adventures and magical quests!"
