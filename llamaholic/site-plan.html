      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The Llamaholic website serves as the online hub for my YouTube channel
        dedicated to showcasing and sharing information about llamas. Visitors
        can explore videos featuring these amazing animals while learning
        interesting facts and details about different llamas. This site is
        designed to inform and entertain llama enthusiasts and anyone curious
        about these fascinating creatures.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The target audience includes llama enthusiasts, animal lovers, and
        anyone with a sense of humor who appreciates these unique creatures.
        Visitors range from casual viewers looking for entertaining animal
        content to dedicated fans seeking information about specific llamas.
        They come to the site to watch videos, learn fun facts, and connect with
        a community of fellow llama admirers.

      <h2>Dynamic Elements (JavaScript)</h2>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Interactive Llama Gallery:</strong> The site will feature
        clickable llama images that expand to full size when clicked, using
        event listeners and DOM manipulation to toggle image sizes and display
        detailed information. Clicking on a llama's name will also trigger the
        expansion to show additional details about that specific llama.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dynamic Content Display:</strong> Llama data (names,
        descriptions, YouTube video links, images) will be stored in an array of
        objects. JavaScript will use array methods (forEach, map, or filter) to
        dynamically generate and display llama cards on the page. ES modules
        will be used to organize the code by separating data management from
        display functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Interactive Features:</strong> Conditional logic will determine
        which content to display based on user interactions (e.g.,
        showing/hiding expanded llama information, checking if a video link
        exists before displaying it). Event listeners will handle clicks on
        images, names, and YouTube links to create a responsive and engaging
        user experience.

      <p><strong>Welcome Message:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Side effects of being a LlamaHolic may include uncontrollable smiling at
        fluffy animals, spontaneous "HAAA!" noises in public, and an
        irresistible urge to buy sweaters covered in llama patterns. You might
        also find yourself naming inanimate objects after barnyard royalty or
        googling "How much does a llama cost in my state?" at 2:37 AM. Avoid
        interaction with llamas if you're allergic to cuteness, joy, or
        excessive personality. Consult your doctor to see if llama obsession is
        right for you—though chances are, they'll just say yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you ever feel the urge to buy a second llama, don't call your
        doctor… call us.
      </p>
      <p>We fully support your lifestyle.</p>

      <h4>Actual Llama Bios (Text Content for Website):</h4>

      <p><strong>Cinnamon</strong></p>
      <img src="images/Cinnimon.JPG" alt="Cinnamon the baby llama" />
      <p>
        Meet Cinnamon, one of our adorable baby llamas born this spring! This
        little bundle of fluff is still discovering the world around him and
        learning what it means to be a llama. Cinnamon got his name from his
        beautiful cinnamon-brown coat that seems to glow in the sunlight. He's
        incredibly curious and loves to explore everything with his big,
        innocent eyes. Watch him bounce around the pasture with pure joy and
        energy that only a baby llama can have. Cinnamon is still nursing but is
        starting to nibble on hay and grass, often making the funniest faces as
        he tries new foods. His favorite activity? Following his mama around and
        trying to imitate everything the older llamas do!
      </p>

      <p><strong>Panda</strong></p>
      <img src="images/panda.jpeg" alt="Panda the baby llama" />
      <p>
        Panda is another precious baby llama born this spring! Named for her
        striking black and white patches that make her look like her namesake,
        Panda is the more cautious of the two babies. While Cinnamon charges
        ahead, Panda likes to observe first and think things through. Don't let
        her careful nature fool you though—once she decides something is safe,
        she's all in! Panda has the softest fleece you've ever felt and the
        longest eyelashes that would make anyone jealous. She's still learning
        to make proper llama sounds, and her attempts at humming often come out
        as adorable squeaks. Panda loves snuggling up for naps in sunny spots
        and has already learned that humans often have treats in their pockets.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Shrek</strong></p>
      <img src="images/shrek.jpeg" alt="Shrek the pack llama" />
      <p>
        Shrek is our experienced pack llama from Idaho, and he's the
        professional of the group. This working llama has spent years on
        mountain trails, carrying gear for hikers and explorers across the
        rugged Idaho wilderness. Shrek is incredibly strong, reliable, and knows
        his job well. Despite his serious work ethic, he has a surprisingly
        goofy personality that emerges when he's not on duty. His beautiful
        whitish coat has seen many adventures, and he carries himself with the
        confidence of a llama who knows exactly what he's doing. Shrek is
        patient and gentle, making him perfect for teaching the babies proper
        llama behavior. He's also food-motivated (a crucial trait for pack llama
        training) and will do almost anything for his favorite treats. When he's
        not working or training, Shrek enjoys a good roll in the dust and
        showing off his impressive packing skills.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Michelle Ollama</strong></p>
      <img
        src="images/michelleollama.jpeg"
        alt="Michelle Ollama the wild llama"
      />
      <p>
        Michelle Ollama has the most dramatic backstory of our herd—she's a wild
        llama who was caught in northern Utah! Before joining our family,
        Michelle roamed free, which explains her independent spirit and slightly
        aloof demeanor. She's still getting used to domestic life, though she's
        made remarkable progress. Michelle has a striking dark grey coat with a
        distinctive white face, and moves with the grace of a llama who grew up
        navigating mountain terrain on her own terms. Michelle is now a proud
        mama to her baby, Cloud, and motherhood has softened her wild edges just
        a bit. She's wary of humans but incredibly intelligent and observant,
        always watching everything with her sharp eyes. While she's not as
        cuddly as some llamas, she has her own dignity and charm. She's teaching
        us that llamas are magnificent animals who deserve respect, and we're
        honored that she's chosen to stay with us. Slowly but surely, Michelle
        is learning to trust, and every small step forward feels like a victory.
